 * xcb_take_socket allows external code to ask XCB for permission to

 * request XCB sent. The caller of xcb_take_socket must supply a
 * callback which XCB can call when it wants the write side of the
 * socket back to make a request. This callback synchronizes with the
 * external socket owner and flushes any output queues if appropriate.
 * If you are sending requests which won't cause a reply, please note the
 * comment for xcb_writev which explains some sequence number wrap issues.
 *
 * All replies that are generated while the socket is owned externally have
 * @p flags applied to them. For example, use XCB_REQUEST_CHECK if you don't
 * want errors to go to xcb's normal error handling, but instead having to be
 * picked up via xcb_wait_for_reply(), xcb_poll_for_reply() or
 * xcb_request_check().
